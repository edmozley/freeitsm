/**
 * War room — the chat analysts fall back to when Teams/Slack is unavailable.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. When the internet drops, the on-premise service desk is the
 * last thing still running on the LAN — and it already knows every analyst, who
 * is in which team, and what is currently on fire. So it is the natural place
 * for people to gather.
 *
 * 🔑 IT BEING A FALLBACK IS NOT A LICENCE TO MAKE IT THIN. The first cut had
 * team channels and nothing else, on the theory that a break-glass tool should
 * stay minimal. That was the wrong instinct: a tool nobody enjoys using in calm
 * conditions is not the one they reach for at 3am, and an outage is the worst
 * possible moment to discover you cannot start a side conversation or find what
 * somebody said forty minutes ago. So: real channels, direct messages, search
 * and attachments.
 *
 * WHAT WE KEPT FROM THE FIRST CUT, because these were right:
 *
 *   NO EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES. No CDN asset, no cert, no token, no scheduled job.
 *   A tool for the day the internet is down must not have a dependency that can
 *   expire or fail to resolve while it is down — which is why retention is
 *   applied on write rather than by cron, and why the channels an analyst needs
 *   are created on demand rather than by an administrator setting them up in
 *   advance. The one part that DOES need the internet — the AI situation report
 *   — is strictly additive: it is a panel, and the chat neither calls it nor
 *   waits for it. When the provider is unreachable the report says so and the
 *   room carries on.
 *
 *   TEAM CHANNELS ARE STILL DERIVED. A team channel is keyed to its team and
 *   CASCADEs with it, so it cannot be renamed into a lie or orphaned. Custom
 *   channels and DMs are rows, and they do carry a lifecycle — that is the cost
 *   of the feature, paid deliberately rather than avoided.
 *
 * Service layer: the UI page and every API endpoint come through here, so the
 * access rule exists once. See [[Service-Layer-Architecture]].

 * Search the conversations this analyst can see.

 * 🔑 DELIBERATELY `LIKE`, NOT THE FULL-TEXT CORPUS, for two reasons that both

 *
 *   1. MySQL's full-text index has a MINIMUM TOKEN SIZE — three characters by
 *      default — and anything shorter is not ranked low, it is never recorded at
 *      all. `P1`, `AD`, `DB`, `VM`, `DC`, `HQ` and any single octet of an IP
 *      address are all below it. The search returns nothing, with no error.
 *   2. Full text tokenises on non-word characters, so `10.0.0.5`, `SRV-01` and a
 *      UNC path are split into pieces and cannot be matched as one string
 *      without boolean-mode quoting the user has no reason to know about.
 *
 * A substring scan has neither problem. Chat volumes are small — retention bounds
 * the table, and it holds one row per message rather than per document — so the
 * scan is the right trade here even though it would be the wrong one for tickets.
 * ⚠️ If war room volumes ever stop being small, the fix is an index, NOT moving to
 * full text: that would silently lose case 1 again.
 *
 * Scoping is inside the query, not applied to the results afterwards: filtering
 * afterwards silently starves the result set when the matches are in channels you
 * cannot see.
 *
 * @param string $query  the words typed; up to six, all must appear (substring match)

 * messages first. That is why it asks for what changed, what is still unknown and
 * what the business would want told — and why it is told to say when the chat
 * does not support a conclusion. A summary that invents a cause reads exactly like
 * one that found a cause, and it goes out to the whole company under somebody's
 * name.
 *
 * @param array $lines  the transcript lines from warRoomTranscriptSince()
 * @param string $sinceLabel  how far back the transcript goes, in words, e.g. '30 minutes ago'

    return <<<PROMPT
You are helping a service delivery manager write an update to the business during
an IT incident. Below is the chat between analysts in the war room since {$sinceLabel}.

Write a briefing with these headings, using only what the transcript supports:

**Where things stand** — two or three sentences a non-technical executive can read.
**What changed since {$sinceLabel}** — bullets, newest development first.
**Who is doing what** — bullets naming the analyst, only where the chat says so.
**Still unknown** — the open questions, including anything being guessed at.
**Suggested wording for the business** — one short paragraph they could send as-is.

Rules:
- Use ONLY the transcript. If it does not say something, do not supply it.
- Where analysts are speculating, say they are speculating. Do not promote a
  guess to a cause, and do not offer an ETA the chat has not given.
- If the conversation is too thin to brief on, say exactly that in one line under
  "Where things stand" and leave the other sections empty rather than padding them.
- Plain British English. No preamble, no sign-off, no restating these rules.
